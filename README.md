# HR-Analytics-HR-Attrition
P.S- IN THE ipynb FILE I DONT KNOW HOW IN GRIDSEARCH CV MY PARAMETERS GOT OMITTED IN THE GITHUB. I AM NOT UPDATING IT BECAUSE EVALUATORS MAY THINK I UPLOADED IT LATER. SO THE OMITTED PORTION THAT WANT UPLOADED IN THE CODE IS THE FOLLOWING:
parameters = {'max_depth': np.arrange(2,15),
              'criterion':['gini','entropy']}
